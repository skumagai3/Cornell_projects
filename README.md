# Cornell_projects
Assorted projects and code snippets from astronomy and physics classes at Cornell.

Some of this code is from ALFALFA but will not contain the requisite .csv data files necessary to actually work with it.
Similarly, if the project is likely to come up as homework for future Cornellians then it will not be included. 

Everything is using Python.
